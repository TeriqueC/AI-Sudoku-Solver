# Sudoku interface

## Importance of interface implementation
the main focus for the start of my project needs to be the interface for displaying the sudoku. this is a necessary starting point as in order to demonstrate Artificial Intelligence solving the sudoku, my product needs to be able to display both the unsolved and solved solution in a way that is easily digested by the target audience. the borders, regions, numbers and void values need to be distinct and observable to those trying to understand what the AI algorithms is trying to achieve, and if the algorithms are doing so correctly. that makes this element of the product integral to the development of my project.

## Implementation of sudoku interface
in order to implement this feature, i have decided to initially work on a console based interface. i felt this was necessary as my first iteration of the sudoku interface only needs to display an easily readable representation of the sudoku puzzle. this was achievable in the console as the borders can be represented through the '-' character for row division and '|' character for column division, the numbers as just numbers and the void values as an '*' character. this gave a simple and easy to read sudoku display on the console.

## Planned improvments to the interface
Once the other features of my project have become slightly more developed, I plan to return to improve the sudoku interface through various means, such as randomised sudoku generation of varying difficultly, as well as a better user interface to display the sudoku rather than primarily using the console, which works well and is readable, but is not the best means of displaying the puzzle in a visually appealing and user friendly fashion.

# Solving algorithms

My main focus moving forwards will be to begin the implementation of some of the puzzle solving AI algorithms, i need to begin starting to take input and provide output to be displayed to the user to demonstrate using AI to solve a sudoku puzzle.

need to waffle about the development of the GUI, explain the problems faced and overcame through my development.
