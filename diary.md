# Sudoku interface

## Importance of interface implementation
The main focus for the start of my project needs to be the interface for displaying the sudoku. this is a necessary starting point as in order to demonstrate Artificial Intelligence solving the sudoku, my product needs to be able to display both the unsolved and solved solution in a way that is easily digested by the target audience. the borders, regions, numbers and void values need to be distinct and observable to those trying to understand what the AI algorithms is trying to achieve, and if the algorithms are doing so correctly. that makes this element of the product integral to the development of my project.

## Implementation of sudoku interface
In order to implement this feature, i have decided to initially work on a console based interface. i felt this was necessary as my first iteration of the sudoku interface only needs to display an easily readable representation of the sudoku puzzle. this was achievable in the console as the borders can be represented through the '-' character for row division and '|' character for column division, the numbers as just numbers and the void values as an '*' character. this gave a simple and easy to read sudoku display on the console.

## Planned improvments to the interface
Once the other features of my project have become slightly more developed, I plan to return to improve the sudoku interface through various means, such as randomised sudoku generation of varying difficultly, as well as a better user interface to display the sudoku rather than primarily using the console, which works well and is readable, but is not the best means of displaying the puzzle in a visually appealing and user friendly fashion.

# Solving algorithm

## how a backtracking algorithm could solve a sudoku
A backtracking works similar to how a human would back track. The algorithms makes an attempt to solve a problem. so in the case of a sudoku it would attempt to fill in blank squares with a potential solution, and when a problem occurs in its solution, it goes back to the cause of the problem, which would be the invalid potential solution in that square or a previous one, and continues its attempt with a different solution for the sudoku, and this is done repeatedly till a viable solution is formed.â€‹

## implementation of backtracking algorithm
When developing the solving algorithm, first came the crutial element of finding a blank square in the grid, this would be represented by a 0 in the sudoku grid array. the coordinates on the grid would be returned to the main algorithm when found, then using these, the main loop will attempt to fill the square with numbers ranging from 1 to the max value, which is also the length of the grid (usually 9), until a viable value for the square is found (a value that is not repeated in the row, column or sub-grid). if a viable value cannot be found, the algorithm clears the current square and backtracks to the previous square, and checks the next values for viability, if there are no viable values, the algorithm will clear the current square and backtrack once again to the square before and once again try different values until a different viable value is found and the algorithm searches for the next blank value and the algorithm repeats itself, until there is no more blank squares, or no more values to try on the grid that gives a solution to the problem.

## planned improvements for the backtracking algorithm
In order to improve the speeds of my backtracking algoritihm, I would need to look into my uses of exhaustive searches which is used alot in my algorithm for different functionalities such as, finding an empty square by looping through every value in the grid array, checking validity of a value by searching through every value in the row, column and sub-grid for a repeated value. this is very inefficient and I believe this can be rectified by maybe implementing faster search algorithms or making use of other methods and techniques to make the searches slightly quicker and efficient, which is necessary to prove AI's superior problem solving capabilities.

# improvement of the user interface

## creating a Graphical user interface
When creating my graphical user interface to display the sudoku and the solving algorithm, I decided to pygame as it provides an adaptable environment in which the sudoku grid can be drawn on the window and updated with little difficulty while still being able to display a way of visualising the backtracking algorithm. when creating the grid I decided to give it the length 340 which was big enough for the user to see the sudoku and the values in each square clearly. When dividing the grid into sub-grids I used the same divisor logic used in the console print function, however I divided the grid visually using thicker lines to create the division between the whole and sub grids. I then started adding values to square by placing a new square over the empty square with the intended value, this could be cleared through overwritting the square by filling the surface with a white square then updating the value to a new square to cover the cleared square. this function would be need to be called every time the value changed in the algorithm in order to give the visual backtracking effect.

## the benefits of having a GUI to display the problem solving algorithm
By introducing a GUI to display the solving algorithm, I am able to show the step by step solution being formed through mistake adaptation approach my backtracking algorithm takes as well as showing how quickly the computer can calculate this as the GUI updates the values very rapidly, demonstrating how much faster a computer is compared to a human, despite the GUI technically wasting computer processing speed, so it is faster to print the output directly then updating a GUI, but then the algorithm will not be demonstrated in an easily comprehensible manner.

## planned improvements to the GUI
In order to improve the Graphical User Interface I plan to make use of radio buttons or checkboxes to select which algorithm to use when solving the puzzle, I also feel a reset button to clear the grid and start button to start the algorithm would also be a nice touch, and will make the application experience more convienient. Additional text would also be needed, and useful for displaying the time it takes for solving the problem as well as potentially a mistakes counter for how efficiently/accurately it initially solves the problem.

# next solving algorithm

## how could a Neural Network solve a sudoku
My focus moving forwards will be on developing a Neural Network that will be trained on taking in sudoku solutions, this is so that it will learn what a solution to a sudoku should look like and it should recognise the patterns/rules of a sudoku so that when it is faced against a incomplete sudoku, it will be able to provide an accurate prediction of a solution, that will hopefully be the correct answer to the inputted problem.
