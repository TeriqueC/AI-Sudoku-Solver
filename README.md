# Final Year Project

main application: Main.py

running Main.py will open a pygame window in which contains a grid, an instruction section on the right which explains to the user how to use the application and underneath a section which contains the time it takes for the algorithm to find its solution, and the mistakes it made to come to that conclusion.

the instructions explains which inputs trigger which events to demonstrate the 2 different algorithms, backtracking solving algorithm which is triggered with the Enter key and the convolutional neural network which is triggered with the Space key, and how to switch between sudokus of increasing difficulties which uses the numbered keys 1-4 to switch between the problems, the higher the number, the more difficult the sudoku, with exception to 4 which switches to a sudoku without a solution, testing how the algorithm reacts to an unsolveable problem.
